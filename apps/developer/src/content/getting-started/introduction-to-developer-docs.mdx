# Welcome to the Developer Documentation!

Hello there, developer! ðŸ‘‹

This documentation is your central hub for understanding the **programmermahin-advanced** project. Whether you're looking to contribute, integrate, or simply understand how things work under the hood, you've come to the right place.

Our monorepo is managed using **Turbo** and **pnpm**, ensuring an efficient development experience across different packages.

## What's Inside?

Our goal is to provide clear, concise, and comprehensive information to help you get up to speed quickly and efficiently. Here, you'll find:

*   **Getting Started Guides:** Step-by-step instructions to set up your development environment (using `pnpm` and `dotenv-cli` for scripts like `pnpm dev`) and run the project locally.
*   **Architectural Overviews:** High-level explanations of the project's structure, core components, and how they interact within our Turborepo setup.
*   **API References (if applicable):** Detailed information about public APIs, including any related to Algolia integration.
*   **Component Libraries/UI Guides:** Documentation for reusable UI components (likely built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS), design patterns, and styling guidelines.
*   **Contribution Guidelines:** Information on how to contribute code, report bugs, suggest features, and our coding standards (including linting with `pnpm lint` and formatting with `prettier`).
*   **Deployment Instructions:** Guides on how to build (`pnpm build`) and deploy the application to various environments.
*   **Troubleshooting Tips:** Solutions to common problems and frequently asked questions.

## Who is this For?

This documentation is primarily aimed at:

*   **Software Developers:** New and existing team members working directly on the `programmermahin-advanced` codebase.
*   **Contributors:** Open-source contributors looking to make enhancements or fix bugs.
*   **Integrators (if applicable):** Developers looking to integrate this project with other systems or services.
*   **Anyone curious:** If you're technically inclined and want to learn more about the project's internals.

## Navigating These Docs

We've tried to organize the documentation logically. Use the sidebar navigation (if your documentation site has one) to browse through different sections. The search functionality can also be a powerful tool to quickly find specific information.

If you're new here, we highly recommend starting with the **Getting Started** guide. *(Adjust the link if your getting started file has a different name or path).*

## Key Technologies & Concepts
### Hello world 3
#### Hello world 4
##### Hello world 5

This project leverages a modern tech stack. Familiarity with the following will be beneficial:

*   **Node.js (>=18):** As specified in our `package.json`.
*   **pnpm:** Our package manager.
*   **Turbo:** For managing our monorepo and optimizing build/dev scripts.
*   **React & Next.js:** The core frontend framework (implied by `.next/` in `.gitignore` and common usage).
*   **TypeScript:** For static typing and improved code quality (see `check-types` script).
*   **Tailwind CSS:** For utility-first styling, including `@tailwindcss/typography` and `tailwindcss-animate`.
*   **Algolia:** For search functionality, configured via environment variables like `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API`.
*   **MDX:** For writing content that blends Markdown with JSX components (as you're doing now!).
*   **State Management:** Potentially `@reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux` as listed in dependencies.
*   **Forms:** `react-hook-form` with `zod` for validation.

## Environment Configuration

The project uses environment variables for configuration, especially for services like Algolia.
*   You'll find an example configuration in the `.env.example` file:
    ```bash
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API=your_search_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=your_app_id
    NEXT_ALGOLIA_WRITE_API=your_write_api_key
    ```
*   Make sure to create your own `.env` file (e.g., by copying `.env.example`) and populate it with the necessary values for local development.
*   Sensitive keys like `NEXT_ALGOLIA_WRITE_API` should be kept secure. The `.env` file is correctly listed in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive information.

## Contributing to the Docs
