# Using Props in React ðŸš—

## What are Props?

**Props** (short for "properties") are arguments you pass into React components. Think of them like **function parameters** in JavaScript or **attributes** in HTML.

They allow you to pass data from one component to another.

---

## Why Use Props?

Props help you make components **dynamic** and **reusable**. Instead of hardcoding values, you can pass them in as props!

---

## Basic Example

Let's start with a simple example:

```jsx
// [!code word:props]
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;
```

Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s happening:
- We created a Car component.
- We passed a prop called brand with the value "Ford".
- Inside the Car component, we used props.brand to access the value.

## Passing Props from Another Component
Letâ€™s create a parent component called Garage and pass props from it to Car.
```jsx
// [!code word:props]
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand="Ford" /> // [!code highlight]
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);

```
Now, `Garage` is the parent and `Car` is the child component.

## Passing an Object as a Prop
You can pass objects as props too:
```jsx
function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand.model }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  const carInfo = { name: "Ford", model: "Mustang" }; // [!code highlight]
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand={carInfo} /> // [!code highlight]
    </>
  );
}
```
In this example:
- We passed the entire `carInfo` object.
- Inside `Car`, we accessed the `model` using `props.brand.model`.

### Summary
- Props let you pass data from parent to child components.
- Props are read-only.
- You can pass strings, numbers, variables, and even objects as props.
