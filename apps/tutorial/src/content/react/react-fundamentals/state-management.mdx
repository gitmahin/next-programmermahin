# State Management in React ⚛️

---

State is one of the most important concepts in React. It allows components to create and manage their own data — like user input, toggles, or counters — and update the UI when that data changes.

In this tutorial, you'll learn what **state** is, how to use it with the `useState` hook, and when to use **lifting state up** and **global state**.

## What is State?

State refers to data that changes over time in your application.

For example:
- The number of items in a shopping cart
- Whether a modal is open or closed
- The text inside an input box

React uses the `useState` hook to manage state inside functional components.

## Basic useState Example

Let’s build a simple counter using state.

```jsx
// [!code word:useState]
import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Count: {count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button> // [!code highlight]
    </>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

## Explanation
- `useState(0)` declares a state variable named `count` and sets its initial value to `0`.
- `setCount` is the function used to update `count`.
- When you click the button, `setCount` increases the value and React re-renders the component.
