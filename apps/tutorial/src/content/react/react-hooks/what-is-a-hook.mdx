# What is a Hook in React?

---

Hooks are one of the most powerful features in React. Introduced in **React 16.8**, Hooks let you use **state** and other React features inside **function components** — without writing a class! Some built-in hooks include:

- `useState()` – for state management
- `useEffect()` – for side effects (like fetching data)
- `useContext()` – for accessing context

## Why Hooks?

Before Hooks, if you needed state or lifecycle methods, you had to use **class components**. With Hooks, function components can do everything a class component can do — and more — with cleaner and easier-to-read code.

## React Hook Rules
To use Hooks correctly, keep in mind these three rules:

- ✅ Hooks can only be called inside function components.
- ✅ Hooks must be called at the top level of the component.
- ❌ Don’t use hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
- ✅ Hooks must always be used in the same order.
- ⚠️ Hooks do not work in class components.
