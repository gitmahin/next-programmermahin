# Getting Started with Bash Text Processing üìù

Bash text processing is about manipulating and analyzing text files directly from your command line. 

We‚Äôll cover four essential commands used in Bash for text processing: `grep`, `cut`, `awk`, and `sed`.

## grep ‚Äì Search Text
`grep` is used to search for lines that match a pattern in a file or input stream. Ideal for filtering logs, configs, or any plain-text data.

*Use when you want to find specific words, patterns, or lines.*

## cut ‚Äì Slice Fields
cut is used to extract specific columns or fields from a line of text, especially when data is separated by a delimiter (like commas or tabs).

*Use when you want only certain fields from structured text.*

## awk ‚Äì Pattern Scanning & Processing
awk is a powerful tool for reading, processing, and transforming structured text line by line. It supports logic, conditions, and field manipulation.

*Use when you need custom output or calculations on structured data.*


## sed ‚Äì Stream Editor
sed is used for finding and replacing text, deleting lines, or performing basic text transformations in streams or files.

*Use when you want to make changes to text in-place or automate text edits.*
