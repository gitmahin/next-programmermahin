# Bash Create Files

## 1. Creating Empty Files With touch

The `touch` command is primarily used to change the access and modification timestamps of a file. However, if the specified file does not exist, `touch` will create an empty file with that name. This makes it ideal for creating placeholder files.

```bash
touch my-file.txt
```
If my-file.txt already exists, its timestamps will be updated to the current time. If it doesn't exist, it will be created as an empty file.

To verify whether the file's timestamps were actually updated, you can use the `stat` command.
```bash
stat my-file.txt

# output:
#   File: my-file.txt
#   Size: 0         	Blocks: 0          IO Block: 4096   regular empty file
# Device: 259,5	Inode: 7128669     Links: 1
# Access: (0664/-rw-rw-r--)  Uid: ( 1000/   lxxxv)   Gid: ( 1000/   lxxxv)
# Access: 2025-07-05 15:12:06.015863578 +0600
# Modify: 2025-07-05 15:12:06.015863578 +0600
# Change: 2025-07-05 15:12:06.015863578 +0600
# Birth: 2025-07-05 15:11:53.152051790 +0600
```
### Creating Multiple Empty Files At Once
```bash
touch file1.txt file2.log report.pdf
```

## Options with touch
- `-a` - Update only when the file was last read
- `-m` - Update only when the file was last changed
- `-t` - Set the timestamp to a specific time
- `-c` - Do not create any files

## 2. Creating Files With Content Using Redirection
The most common way to create a file and populate it with content in one go is by using output [redirection operators](/devops/linux-and-bash-scripting/bash-scripting/input-output-redirection-operators-in-bash) (`>`, `>>`).
- **`>` (Redirection / Overwrite):** This operator redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists, its content will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
    ```bash
    # [!code word:>]
    echo "Hello, learner." > welcome.txt
    echo "Hello, learner again." > welcome.txt
    cat welcome.txt
    # Output: Hello, learner again.
    ```
- **`>>`(Append Redirection):** This operator redirects the standard output of a command to a file. If the file exists, the new content will be appended to the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
    ```bash
    # [!code word:>>]
    echo "First line of text." > logfile.txt # Create and write
    echo "Second line appended." >> logfile.txt # Append
    echo "Third line also appended." >> logfile.txt # Append
    cat logfile.txt
    # Output:
    # First line of text.
    # Second line appended.
    # Third line also appended.
    ```
