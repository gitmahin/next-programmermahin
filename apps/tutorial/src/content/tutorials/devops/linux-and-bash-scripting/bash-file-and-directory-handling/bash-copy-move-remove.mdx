# Copy, Move & Remove

## Copy

In Bash, `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` are three fundamental commands for managing your files and directories. They allow you to copy, move (or rename), and remove items on your system.

### Basic Usage
To make a copy of a file, specify the source file and then the destination file name for the copy.
```bash
cp myfile.txt backup.txt
```
Now, you will have two identical files: myfile.txt and backup.txt.

### Copying a File to a Directory
You can also copy a file into an existing directory. In this case, the destination is the path to the directory. The copied file will retain its original name within that directory.

**Example:**
To copy report.docx into the documents folder:
```bash
cp report.docx documents/
```
Or, to copy it into documents and give it a new name final_report.docx:
```bash
cp report.docx documents/final_report.docx
```
## cp Options
- `-r`	Copy directories recursively (including all files and subdirectories).
- `-i`	Interactive mode: Prompts before overwriting an existing file.
- `-u`	Update: Copy only if the source file is newer than the destination file, or if the destination file doesn't exist.
- `-v`	Verbose mode: Shows the name of each file as it's copied.

### -r Copy Directories & Files Recursively

**Example:** Copy files to directory
Copy multiple files to any directory.
```bash
cp -r text.txt myfile.txt mynote.txt /sandbox
```

**Example:** Copy directory to another directory
```bash
cp -r myfolder sandbox
```

## Move or Rename Files and Directories

The mv command is used for two main purposes: moving files/directories to a different location, or renaming files/directories.

### Moving a File
To move a file, specify the source file and the destination directory.
```bash
mv <source_file> <destination_directory>/
```

### Renaming Files and Directories
mv is also the command you use to rename a file or directory. You simply specify the current name as the source and the new name as the destination.
```bash
mv <old_name> <new_name>
mv draft.txt final_version.txt
```
Similarly, to rename a directory:
```bash
mv old_project_folder new_project_folder
```
### mv Options
- `-i`	Interactive mode: Prompts before overwriting an existing file/directory.
- `-u`	Update: Move only if the source file is newer than the destination file, or if the destination file doesn't exist.
- `-v`	Verbose mode: Shows the name of each file/directory as it's moved.
