# Making Directories with mkdir ðŸ“‚
---

The mkdir command (short for **"make directory"**) in Bash is for creating new folders or directories on your system. It's essential for keeping your files organized.

To create a new, empty directory, run:

```bash
mkdir myfolder
```

### Summary of mkdir Options
- `-p`: Create parent directories as needed.
- `-v`: Show a message for each directory created.
- `-m`:	Set file mode (permissions) for the new directory.

## Creating Parent Directories with -p
Sometimes you want to create a directory deep within a structure, but the parent directories don't exist yet. The `-p` (parents) option comes to the rescue! It will create any necessary parent directories along the way.

```bash
mkdir -p myfolder/bash/tutorial-1
```
