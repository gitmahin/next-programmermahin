# Bash Basic Commands
---
This tutorial will cover the absolute basics you need to start navigating and interacting with your Unix/Linux file system.

**We'll focus on:**

- Listing files and directories (`ls`)
- Changing directories (`cd`)
- Printing your current directory (`pwd`)
- Printing text to the terminal (`echo`)

## 1. Bash Listing
It allows you to see the contents of a directory.

```bash
ls
```
Example output:
```bash
Desktop    Documents    Downloads   Music    Pictures    Public    Templates    Videos    my_file.txt
```
