# Bash Basic Commands
---
This tutorial will cover the absolute basics you need to start navigating and interacting with your Unix/Linux file system.

**We'll focus on:**

- Listing files and directories (`ls`)
- Changing directories (`cd`)
- Printing your current directory (`pwd`)
---
## 1. Bash Listing ls
It allows you to see the contents of a directory.

```bash
ls
```
Example output:
```bash
Desktop    Documents    Downloads   Music    Pictures    Public    Templates    Videos    my_file.txt
```

### Some Important Options With ls
- `-l` - Long listing format
- `-a` - Include hidden files

Examples:
```bash
ls -l
ls -a
```

You can also write all options at once
```bash
ls -la
```

## 2. Bash Change Directory cd
The `cd` command (short for "change directory") is how you navigate through your file system.

To move into a specific directory, type `cd` followed by the directory's name.
```bash
cd Documents
```
<p style={{fontSize: "13px"}}>
*You have to go to home directory to change directory to `Documents`*.
</p>

After this command, your current location in the terminal will be inside the `Documents` directory.

### Options With cd
- **(Go Up One Level):** `cd ..`
This command moves you to the one level up directory from your current location.
- **Switch to the previous directory:** `cd -`
- **Change to the root directory:** `cd /`
- **Change to the home directory:** `cd ~`
    - The `cd ~` command takes you to your home directory, which is the default directory for your user account.

## 3. Bash Print Directory pwd
The `pwd` command (short for "print working directory") simply tells you your current location in the file system. It's like asking "Where am I?"
```bash
pwd
```
Example output:
```bash
/home/yourusername/Documents
```
