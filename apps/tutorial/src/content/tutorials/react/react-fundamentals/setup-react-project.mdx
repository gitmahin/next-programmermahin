# Setting Up a React Project with Vite

---

In this tutorial, we will guide you through setting up a React project using **Vite**, a fast build tool that provides a modern and efficient way to work with React. Vite is a great alternative to tools like Webpack, offering faster builds and hot module replacement.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)

You can check if these are installed by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If not, you can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en).

### Step 1: Create a New React Project with Vite
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Run the following command to create a new project using Vite:

```bash
 npm create vite@latest
```
This command does the following:

- Creates a new project folder called my-react-app.

- Initializes a new React project using the Vite template.

You will be prompted to select a framework template. Select React when prompted.

or,
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate into your project directory:
```bash
cd my-react-app
```
Next, install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all the dependencies that Vite and React need for your project.

### Step 3: Start the Development Server
Now that the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will start the Vite development server and you can view your application in the browser by going to: `http://localhost:3000`
