# Setting Up Your C++ Environment

Before you can start writing and running C++ programs, you need to set up your development environment. This includes installing a compiler, an editor or IDE, and configuring your system for development.

## What Youâ€™ll Need

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code) or an IDE (e.g., CLion, Code::Blocks)

---

## Installing on Windows

### Option 1: Install MSYS2 + GCC

1. Download and install **[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)**.
2. Open the MSYS2 terminal and run:

```
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```

3. Add the path to your compiler to the `PATH` environment variable.

### Option 2: Use Visual Studio

- Download **Visual Studio** and install the **Desktop development with C++** workload.

---

## Installing on macOS

Use **Homebrew** to install the latest version of GCC or Clang:

```
brew install gcc
```

You can also use the pre-installed Clang compiler by default.

---

## Installing on Linux

Most distributions already come with a compiler. To ensure it's installed:

For Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

For Fedora:

```
sudo dnf install gcc-c++
```

---

## Setting Up VS Code (Optional)

1. Install **[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.
2. Install the **C/C++ extension** by Microsoft.
3. Configure your `tasks.json` and `launch.json` files for compiling and running code.


---

## Verify Installation

To check if your compiler is working, run:

```
g++ --version
```

Or for Clang:

```
clang++ --version
```

Youâ€™re now ready to write your first C++ program!
